It is commonly known that our apprehension to lose is influencing our decision-making
process greater than the prospect of gain. Research revealed the specific regions of
the brain that are activated by the decision making process. Our study uses data from
an experience where subjects were presented a 50/50 gamble situation with potetial 
gain or loss monetary amount associated.
Behavior data (willingness to take the gamble or not) have been collected as well as
Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent (BOLD) data that monitor brain activity. Our study 
explores the process of modeling brain activity related to the subject given conditions.
A further analysis aims to find the relationship between the blood oxygen level of these 
brain areas and the willingness of the subject to take or not the gamble.
