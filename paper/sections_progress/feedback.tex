\section{Feedback on the class}
\noindent
Here are a few feedback we have for the class:
\begin{itemize}
\item We appreciate the model with 3 (or 4) supervisors having their own expertise. 
\item We would like more exposure to machine learning.
\item The lectures on git workflow and collaboration were very useful but fast-paced. 
\item The lecture on linear algebra was a good refresher but a little bit too theoretical for this project-based class.
\item We would like more linear regressions course focusing on the implementation.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph
\noindent
We also have a ideas of improvement for the class:
\begin{itemize}
\item We propose to support the lecture with slides or handouts with the fundamentals (e.g. git) command for collaborative work) we can refer to after class.
\item We propose to provide a support document with the most used statistics definitions for a good analysis design and interpretation of our data.
\end{itemize}
