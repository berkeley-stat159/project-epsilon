\section{Our Process}
\subsection{Challenges}
\noindent
One of the biggest challenges was to understand the paper and the fMRI data.
Especially in our case given that we want to make a literature review in order
to find the proper parameters (especially) the shape parameter) of the Gamma 
function used to model the hemodynamic response.  
As mentioned before, we also had difficulties with the workflow on git and 
version control management, especially with the branch management and Travis
checks. Consequently, our code review process was not working well. 
As a team, because of our conflicting schedules, we had difficulties to meet
at 5. Besides the class time, we were eventually able to set up a weekly
meeting. The rest of the communication was done via emails essentially or on 
the GitHub platform. 

\subsection{Improving reproducibility}
\noindent
In order to be successful, we will need to improve the reproducibility of our
project. For that, we need to work on adopting a systematic approach for code 
organization following the combo: functions - scripts - tests, and also our 
code syntax following python guidelines (PEP 0008). We also need to work on 
our code review process. 
We also need to generate the supporting documentation to improve the usability
of our project. 
We also would like to exchange with other groups working on the same study in 
order to complement our understanding of the data and analysis.
